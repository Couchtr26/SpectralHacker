# SpectralHacker

SpectralHacker is an educational tool that uses a standard cell phone camera to demonstrate the principles of spectrometry. While not intended for professional scientific measurements, it allows students and families to analyze photographs of galaxies and planets to observe the emission spectra of elemental gases.

## Educational Purpose

- **Accessible Science:** Makes the concept of spectral analysis accessible without expensive lab equipment.
- **STEM Engagement:** Designed for classrooms, science fairs, and family learning.
- **Learning by Doing:** Users can capture their own data and see how scientists analyze light from celestial bodies.

## Limitations

- Not intended for professional or research-grade accuracy.
- Results are sufficient to demonstrate the concept of emission spectra, but subject to the limitations of consumer cameras and lighting conditions.

## Features

- Image capture and processing
- Extraction of color/spectral data
- Visualization of emission lines
- Simple, user-friendly interface for students and educators

## How It Works

1. Take a photo of a light source, galaxy, or planet.
2. The app processes the image to extract color spectra.
3. Visualizes the likely emission lines corresponding to common elements (e.g., hydrogen, helium).

## Why?

Understanding the spectrum of light is key to astronomy and chemistry. SpectralHacker brings this knowledge to anyone with a smartphone, making science more approachable and fun.
